Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the building of apps, games and websites using of code to write these programs and they are made to solve a real life problem. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because they are people who map out what is needed by the client and they build their plans as well, so they are constructors of our apps, games and websites.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Internet- This is most well know and greatest breakthrough in the evolution of software engineering. The internet made is possible foe different communities from different countries to connect, and this made problem solving possible in real time.
AI- this is one of the key milestones in software engineering. The development of artificial intelligence has been a huge milestone, due to the fast processing of data, for example ChatGPT a language model that can produce what you need from it in a matter of seconds.
CLoud computing- Cloud computing is also a key milestone in the evolution of software engineering. This backup system, that makes sure that if something ever happens to any of your electronic devices whereby you will lose your files on one of the specific devices and your files have been backed up to the cloud, you can regain access to these files.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-This part is important, it is important to note what the client wants from the project, what the goals are for the project. This is where you draft a plan like an architect.
Analysis- Now it is important to analyze by gathering data on what the users need and you should then be able to trancend them into specific specifications.
Design- This is where you now go into more detail with your plan and you start creating the basic structure of your project, you also focus on how to make the design user friendly on both PC's and mobiles. So you focus on accessibility as well. This is where you state what your requirements are for what your project must be able to do.
Develop- This is where you use your plan to start coding by using the design specifications.
Test- This is where you test if your code is running smoothly, according to the requirement you have set in your designing process.
Deploy- This is where you distribute your software to your client and your client's clientele base.
Maintenance- You have to regular address issues that the users are experiencing and fix bugs as well as have updates regulary to the software to improve it. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is where there is a linear and sequential process, where you have to complete each step in the sequence of the Software Development Life Cycle in order for you to finish the project, this means that you have less flexibility because once a step is completed it is harder to go back and make improved changes. Scenario 1: You are building a cat app but you following the sequential process and you have deadlines to complete each of the process in a certain amount of time. If you have discovered that there was a mistake where somethinhg is not meeting the requirement set out in the planning stage when designing it is hard to go back and change it, because you have already developed and tested it.

The Agile methodology is a where the big Software Development Life cycle is broken into smaller parts that are focusing on functionality and they are called sprints. This methodology is more flexible because changes can be made and accomodated at any stage. Scenario 2: The client decides that he wants the website to now be an eccomerence platform instead of just an information website on his business, because agile methodology is being used it is easier for the developers of the software to make this change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- The software developer is the one that ensures that the Software Development Life Cycle is followed to design and build the software that is required by the client.
Quality Assurance Engineer- The quality assurance engineer is the one that is required to make sure that the software developed by the software developer is of high quality and meets all the requirements of the client before it is released.
Project Manager- The project manager is responsible to oversee the planning and excutions of the planning by the devloper and to make sure that the project is completed, in due time, on budget and that the software fulfills the requirements of the client.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- It is important because it increases productivity, debugging and testing of the software and it helps with the organising of the code. Example: Visual Studio Code

Version Control Systems (VCS)- It helps you with collaboration with other developers that might be in your team, is saves the history of changes you have made and helps you roll back to previous versions of your code. It also backups your code so that you can easily recover any lost code. Example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constraints is one of the most common challenges, a lot of time is required to go through the Software Development Life Cycle in order for you to deliver on the specifications required by the client, but you always have limited time to test an optimize code that is not working properly.
Maintaining the code quailty is also a common challenge, the quality of your code is always expected to be the same when you do updates or the quality is also sometimes expected to improve.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- This is where individual components are tested of the software. The importance is to see if they are working as expected. 
Integration- This is where you test to see if the different units of the software are working together correctly.Verifies that the units are working together as intended. 
System- This is to test the complete system and if it meets all the specific requirements.Validates that the software is working as required.
Acceptance- This is to validate that the software meets the clients requirements. Validate if the software is working up to standard to what the client has required for the software to do.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is when you design and refine the prompts that are put into AI-models to achieve more accurate and relevant results. The more you interact with AI-models the more they learn.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me something interesting". Can you tell me about the Big Bang Theory and how the first stars were born based on this theory?
